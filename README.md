# CalculateTriangleAngles
 
Thank you for reviewing my technical task

In this repository you'll find: 
1. triangles.html
2. A folder structure for the cypress tests (fully automated from the spreadsheet)

I have also sent over an excel spreadsheet to the recruiter which shows the test cases I have written in Cypress.

##### The triangles.html file#####

I decided to write a mechanism to calculate the numeric values in JavaScript as it felt a rather straight forward manner, plus it allowed me to use html as a wrapper so the testing could be easily automated on a web browser using cypress. 

####How to run the automation####

1. Pull the project to your local machine
2. I would suggest using VS Code but you can run it locally, here are some steps on doing that: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Continuous-integration
3. Open up the directory in Visual Studio Code
4. Open a terminal and type npm install cypress --save-dev
5. Then type npx cypress open 
6. You should now be able to run the cypress tests

Again, a how to guide is here: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Continuous-integration
